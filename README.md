# Welcome to your Lovable project

## One Sentence Pitch

The only app you need to manage every part of your financial life, to democratize wealth. 

## Product Overview
Our project redefines banking by introducing Republica, a multimodal assistant integrated into the Trade Republic app. While traditional banks offer static interfaces, Republica enables intuitive interaction via speech and text, adapting to all users. It educates users on markets, offers investment insights, supports wealth building, and simplifies the German tax system. A personalized "For You" page additionally visualizes portfolio data, categorizes expenses, and delivers short market summaries and curated content. Republica transforms everyday banking into an interactive, intelligent, and accessible experience for everyone.

## Tech Stack

This project is built by embedding a fine-tuned LLM pipeline as a backbone to a custom-developed interface. The interface has been set up using Vite to handle builds and dev tooling, TypeScript for maintainable and developer-friendly code, React and shadcn-ui to provide ready-to-use UI components, and Tailwind CSS for styling. We have used various LLM-based tools to speed up development, such as Lovable and ChatGPT. Within the app, we enable an efficient structure for generating safe OpenAI API requests for interaction via voice and chat. We use models such as mistral-large-latest, gpt-4o-mini, whisper-1 and tts-1. Tools such as Beyond Presence and HeyGen have been employed for automated video content generation to enable user-friendly way of conveying essential information.   

## Challenges faced
